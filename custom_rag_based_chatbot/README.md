This project utilizes cricket player statistics downloaded from internet to address inquiries about player performance. 
The foundational model employed was based on earlier years, which initially could not handle queries for recent years 
like 2023 and 2024 directly. However, by augmenting prompts with corresponding entries from downloaded data using embedding
matching techniques, the chatbot successfully answered questions about player stats for recent years such as 2023 and 2024.

To execute this code, ensure you update the api_key in the CustomChatbot.ipynb file (in the first section) 

The necessary data file cricket_data.csv has already been downloaded from internet and is included here.
